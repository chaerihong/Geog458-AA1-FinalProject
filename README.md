## Project Description
This Geonrrative is a series of maps starting with a broad area and moving to a more localized area, showcasing hospital accessibility. It is a map-based storytelling project with VSCode and Mapbox to publish to GitHub Pages, building our final project off of lab 7. The Geonarrative starts with a map of hospitals as points in the United States, and as users scroll down, they will see a second map showing the location of hospitals as points and county populations in Washington State as the choropleth. The third map will show the total number of beds in hospitals in Washington as a choropleth. Lastly, there is a map showing minority populations in the City of Seattle and locations of hospitals.

The significance of this project idea is that it demonstrates disparities in hospital access, which play an important role in determining overall health outcomes. These maps will look at how the spatial distribution of hospitals varies across the United States, Washington, and Seattle, to see where the absence of hospitals is. This seeks to highlight existing challenges in hospital access, but also how absence may lead to delayed hospital access, and thus health outcomes.

## Functions
Our maps display hospital availability in the United States, Washington, and Seattle. Using a series of datasets, we illustrate patterns in the distribution of hospital access in Washington State. As users scroll downward on the webpage, they will be able to view the various maps listed above as they demonstrate hospital accessibility and disparities in access from a country level to a city level. As users click the the red data points on the maps which are hospitals, users will see the hopsital name and city it is located in as a pop-up. Below, is an example:

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to raise awareness to the lack of accessiblity to hospitals in various regions of the United States, Washington, and Seattle. It highlights how there is a difference in access in different locations, which increases travel times to hospitals which provide essential care and services to people and communities. When people are unable to access hospitals or face differences in access, disparaties occur and health outcomes are affected.

## Target audience
We want our audience to be community members. Bottom-up challenges to authority figures as learned from Stand with #StandingRock are where ordinary people can ignite change or create momentum. Those in government and public policy will be unlikely to build hospitals in areas where there aren't already because of high costs, so hospitals need to be pushed by community voices that unite together. The existence of hospital services that provide essential healthcare services will be important for community members who live in those areas to get services they may need. Informing community members and the public with these facts may bring the topic of medical care up to the table in areas lacking hospital availability. 

Lastly, one of the potential audiences is governmental officials. Informing them of the up-to-date distribution of hospitals locally and nationwide may bring some positive changes.
